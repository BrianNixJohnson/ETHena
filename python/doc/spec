     -

  - how much to buy
     - keep trades low
  - when to buy/ sell
     - models

Part I:
make a bot

  - experiment on bots
  - have a factor of corona
  - have a list of factors which affect the trading value

  - 


testing:

Trading Models
Moving averages
Things to experiment
•	Short moving average
•	Longer moving averages
•	Length of trading – (every hour to every few days?)
•	What is the correct percentage change to buy and sell?
•	How can we calculate this percentage change?
Where am I getting my data to test on?
Terminology:
Exponential moving averages
Simple moving averages
Using time horizons
Cross overs
Offset from moving averages needs to be a factor of the derivative of moving averages
Need to consider how to buy each time the moving average is not in bounds
	Maybe this will depend on the amount it is out of bounds by


ASSUMPTION of PERFECT TRADER
•	Selling all of stock at once
•	Buying maximum amount of stock
•	Offset value is constant
•	Initially buying stock 
TODO:
Implement a way to make sure trader doesn’t sell at a price lower than what it bought for
